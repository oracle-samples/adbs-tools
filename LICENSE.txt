If using the UPL for JavaScript or other circumstances in which space is at a premium, you may use a reference to the license rather than a full copy (though a full copy is always preferred if there's room and you won't be transmitting a bunch of copies to the same user). If you want to use just a short reference, you should still insert a copyright notice, and along with it, a statement that the file is licensed under the UPL, and may link to it at https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl or on the Open Source Initiative web site at https://opensource.org/licenses/UPL.
